<h1> Fantasy Proposal: I-894 </h1>
I-894 is a hypothetical freeway that is an outer ring to the Minneapolis-St. Paul Metropolitan Area. It's only official appearance is in <a href="https://www.dot.state.mn.us/corridorsofcommerce/pdf/suggestedprojects2015.pdf">a planning document</a> for projects from MnDot. I have decided to make a fantasy routing and an exit list for the road. I don't expect this to ever be constructed, and this is completely hypothetical.
